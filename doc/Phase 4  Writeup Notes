Notes: Phase 4 writeup meeting

Use MAC instead of private/public key for T5 Modification, second symmetric key for the MAC

T5 Reorder: Time stamps help but also number the envelopes (See TLS diagram)

T6: Key change needed: Hash the sym key 100 times, when user leaves the group, change key, key versions. Don't worry about lamport
  way. keep it simple. How to reencrypt all files when key is. Look up lazy revocation: reencrypt anything that has changed. Some metadata
  needed.

T7: IP and port is not a unique identifier, use public key (Already unique and we already have it)
